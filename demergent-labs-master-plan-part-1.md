# Demergent Labs Master Plan Part 1

October 12, 2022

Our self-imposed vision at Demergent Labs is to accelerate the adoption of [Web3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web3) and the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) (IC). We believe that a decentralized world computer has the potential to bring various material benefits to mankind. Though we are interested in the success of any decentralized world computer, currently our focus is almost exclusively on the IC.

We are very interested in the success of the IC. Due to some personal efforts and thanks to a grant from [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/), we have already put signifiant engineering efforts towards creating fundamental open source developer tools that we hope will enable many developers to come to the IC. We would like to lay out here our plans for the next 1-2 years.
